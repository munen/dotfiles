* Dotfiles

This repository contains all my public configuration files. I manage
the dotfiles with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

My computers run either Guix System, or Debian with Guix. Non-Free
software, I get through flatpak.

Configuration containing sensitive information is in a separate
private dotfiles repository. It includes configuration for:

#+begin_src shell :results list :exports results
  ls ~/dotfiles_private
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
- ("git")
- ("gnupg")
- ("ssh")

** Install Non-Free software

#+begin_src shell :exports code
  flatpak install -y flathub com.spotify.Client
  flatpak install -y flathub us.zoom.Zoom
  flatpak install -y flathub com.slack.Slack
  flatpak install -y flathub com.github.IsmaelMartinez.teams_for_linux
#+end_src

*** Teams

I'm using the [[https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux][GPL licensed package of Teams]] instead of the version by
Microsoft. Firstly, because the version of Microsoft asks me to login
after I have logged in and then says I have no teams account (yes, it
did) and [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32678839][secondly, because they are about to retire the Linux version]]
of their product.
