* Dotfiles

This repository contains all my public configuration files. I manage
the dotfiles with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

Configuration containing sensitive information is in a separate
private dotfiles repository. It includes configuration for:

#+begin_src shell :results list :exports results
  ls ~/dotfiles_private
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
- ("git")
- ("gnupg")
- ("ssh")
