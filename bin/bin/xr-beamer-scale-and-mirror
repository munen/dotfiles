# This doesn't set the beamer to it's prefered resolution, but to
# 1920x1080 which is a a resolution with the same aspect ratio than
# the one from the X1. This could be improved, of course, by checking
# for the best match from the list returned by `xrandr`.

# NB: If there's little time, `nvidia-settings` has a GUI with which
# all resolutions can be set appropriately. In that, it is better than
# `arandr` which only shows the preferred solution for the internal
# display (which is the max resolution).

# For example this returns the resolution of the internal display (in
#  Ruby)
# res = `xrandr | grep DP-2 | cut -f 3 -d ' '`
# # res === "3840x2160+0+0"
# res.match(/\d+x\d+/)[0]
