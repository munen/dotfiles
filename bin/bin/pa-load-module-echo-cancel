## OLDSCHOOL (using pulseaudio)

# How to use this:
# 1. Connect the devices you want to use (mic + speaker)
# 2. Call this script
# 3. Select both recording and playback devices with echo cancellation
#    in your application (like Zoom). It is important to select both
#    devices which go through the echo cancel virtual device.

## NEWSCHOOL (using pipewire)

# Wait for PipeWire to be ready (loops until 'pactl info' succeeds)
# until pactl info > /dev/null 2>&1; do
#   sleep 1
# done

# # Once ready, start EasyEffects in the background
# # We add PIPEWIRE_LATENCY="1024/48000" to relax the timing requirements
# # 1024 samples at 48kHz is roughly 21ms latency, which eliminates crackling
